AWS APAC Solutions Architecture Virtual Experience Program – Forage (June 2025)
================================================================================

📁 Overview:
-------------
This repository contains my completed work for the AWS APAC Solutions Architecture Virtual Experience, conducted via Forage in June 2025. The program simulated a client-facing cloud architecture scenario for a startup, focusing on designing a scalable, resilient, and cost-effective AWS deployment architecture.

🎯 Project Objective:
---------------------
To design a reliable and scalable cloud-based solution for a client experiencing downtime, slow response times, and deployment issues—using AWS best practices and services. The solution emphasizes auto-scaling, high availability, automated deployments, and disaster recovery.

📌 Key Contributions:
---------------------
• Designed a fault-tolerant, cost-efficient architecture using **Elastic Beanstalk**, **Auto Scaling Groups**, **RDS**, and **S3**.  
• Drafted a professional client-facing email explaining the architecture components, their purpose, and cost structure.  
• Applied best practices around **deployment automation** with **AWS CodePipeline** and **zero-downtime strategies** using blue/green deployments.  
• Integrated **Route 53**, **ELB**, and **S3 static hosting** to ensure fast, globally accessible frontend performance.  
• Presented architecture with a visual diagram to communicate the infrastructure flow and scalability approach clearly.

📌 Architecture Components Used:
--------------------------------
- **Amazon Route 53** – DNS management and routing
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** – Traffic distribution and high availability
- **Elastic Beanstalk with Auto Scaling EC2 Groups** – Scalable backend hosting
- **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** – Managed database with multi-AZ replication
- **Amazon S3** – Static hosting and backup storage
- **AWS CodePipeline** – Automated CI/CD deployment pipeline

📷 Architecture Diagram:
-------------------------
Refer to `architecture_diagram.png` for a visual overview of the deployed architecture (attached in the repository).

📧 Client Communication Sample:
-------------------------------
See `client_email_to_lilly.txt` for the full email draft sent to the client, explaining architectural choices and pricing overview.

📈 Cost Overview:
-----------------
- EC2 / Beanstalk: Auto-scaled, billed per instance-hour  
- RDS: Based on instance type, storage, and replication  
- ELB: Per-hour + data processing  
- S3: Per GB stored/retrieved  
- Route 53 & CodePipeline: Minimal usage-based billing  

🎓 Certification:
